# Necromancer (BOSS)

The Necromancer is a powerful master of the undead, shrouded in mystery and bound to ancient, forbidden magic. Can only be summoned within the eerie confines of a Necromancer Crypt, using the **Necromancer‚Äôs Grimoire** at the **Cryptic Altar**. With its dark energy and relentless minions, the Necromancer is a formidable challenge for even the bravest adventurers.

The **Cryptic Altar** is located at the center of the Crypt. It emanates an otherworldly glow, marking the spot where ancient rituals once took place. This altar is the key to summoning the Necromancer. Place the Grimoire upon it, and prepare to face the wrath of this arcane overlord.
